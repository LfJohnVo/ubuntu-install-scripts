# Ubuntu install scripts

Install scripts for various things I like to install on a fresh Ubuntu.

They save some keystrokes :) Use the `./all-*` scripts to save even more!

Scripts have been tested on Ubuntu Desktop 13.10 64bit. Those in `pending/` are either not finished, do not work correctly or are not used by me.

Happy (re-)installing!
