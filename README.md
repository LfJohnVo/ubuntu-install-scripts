# Ubuntu install scripts

_Install scripts for various things I like to install on a fresh Ubuntu._

They save some keystrokes :) Use the `./all-*` scripts to save even more!

Scripts have been tested on a MacBookPro 10,1 with Ubuntu GNOME 14.04 Desktop 64 bit.

Happy (re-)installing!

## Easy download

	wget -O- https://github.com/hugojosefson/ubuntu-install-scripts/archive/ubuntu-gnome-14.04.tar.gz | tar xzv
	cd ubuntu-install-scripts-ubuntu-gnome-14.04

## TODO

  * Split up which things are general for Ubuntu vs specific for MacBookPro 10,1
  * Split up which things are general for Ubuntu vs specific for Unity
