# Ubuntu install scripts

_Install scripts for various things I like to install on a fresh Ubuntu._

They save some keystrokes :) Use the `./all-*` scripts to save even more!

Scripts have been tested on a MacBookPro 10,1 with Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 Desktop 64 bit.

Happy (re-)installing!

	wget -O- https://github.com/hugojosefson/ubuntu-install-scripts/archive/ubuntu-gnome-15.10.tar.gz | tar xzv
