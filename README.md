# Ubuntu install scripts

_Install scripts for various things I like to install on a fresh Ubuntu._

They save some keystrokes :) Use the `./all-*` scripts to save even more!

Scripts have been tested on Ubuntu Desktop 13.10 64bit. Those in `pending/` are either not finished, do not work correctly or are not used by me.

Happy (re-)installing!

## Easy download

	wget -O- https://github.com/hugojosefson/ubuntu-install-scripts/archive/master.tar.gz | tar xzv
	cd ubuntu-install-scripts-master
