# Fedora install scripts

_Install scripts for various things I like to install on a fresh Fedora._

They save some keystrokes :) Use the `./all-*` scripts to save even more!

Scripts have been tested with Fedora 31.

Happy (re-)installing!

## Easy download

	wget -O- https://github.com/hugojosefson/ubuntu-install-scripts/archive/fedora-31.tar.gz | tar xzv
	cd ubuntu-install-scripts-fedora-31
