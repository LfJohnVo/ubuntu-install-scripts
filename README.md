# Ubuntu install scripts

_Install scripts for various things I like to install on a fresh Ubuntu._

They save some keystrokes :) Use the `./all-*` scripts to save even more!

Scripts have been tested on a MacBookPro 10,1 with Ubuntu Desktop 13.10 64bit. Those in `pending/` are either not finished, do not work correctly or are not used by me.

Happy (re-)installing!

## Easy download

	wget -O- https://github.com/hugojosefson/ubuntu-install-scripts/archive/master.tar.gz | tar xzv
	cd ubuntu-install-scripts-master

## TODO

I should check out:
  * More things to install / configure?
    * http://itsfoss.com/things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-13-10/
  * Split up which things are general for Ubuntu vs specific for MacBookPro 10,1
  * Split up which things are general for Ubuntu vs specific for Unity
